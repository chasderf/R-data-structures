Matrices
A matrix is a two dimensional data set with columns and rows
A column is a vertical representation of data, while a row is a horizontal representation of data

A matrix can be created with matrix ( ) function. Specify the nrow and ncol parameters to get the
amount of rows and columns

Thismatrix <- matrix (c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
Thismatrix

You can also create a matrix with strings

Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“banana”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
Thismatrix
