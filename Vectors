Vectors:

A vector is simply a list of items that are the same type

To combine the list of items to a vector, use the c( ) function and separate the items by a comma

In the example below, we create a vector variable called fruits, that combine strings:

# vector of strings

Fruits <- c(“banana”, “apple”, “orange”)

#print fruits
Fruits

In this example, we create a vector that combines numerical values

//input code

#vector of numerical values
Numbers <-c(1,2,3)
Data <- c(“hi” , “what’s good”)

#print numbers
Numbers
Data

//output ::
[ 1 ] 2, 3
[ 1 ] “hi” “what good”
