Access Vectors

You can access the vector items by referring to its index number inside the bracket [ ]
The first item has index 1, the second item has index 2, and so on

//INPUT
Fruits <- c(“banana”, “apple”, “orange”)
Fruits[1]

//OUPTUT

[1] “banana”

You can also access multiple elemnts by referring to different index positions with the c ( )

Fruits <- c(“banana”, “apple”, “orange:”, “mango”, “lemon”)

Fruits [c(1,3)]

Change an item

To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number :

//INPUT
Fruits <- c(“bannana”, “apple”, “orange”, “mango”, “lemon”)
Fruits [1] <- “pear”
Fruits

//OUTPUT

[1] “pear” “apple” “orange” “mango” “lemon”

Repeat Vectors

To repeat vectors, use the rep( ) function

//INPUT
Repeat_each <- rep (c(1,2,3), each = 3)
Repeat_each

//OUTPUT
[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3
//*INFORAMTION to gain
That it will make copies for each = x

Repeat the sequence of the vector:
Repeat_times <- rep (c(1,2,3), Times = 3)

Repeat_times

[1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

Repeat each value independently

//INPUT
Repeat_indepent <- rep (c(1,2,3), times = c(5,2,1))

Repeat_indepent

//OUTPUT
[1] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3

Generating sequenced vectors
One of the examples on top, showed you how to create a vector with numerical values in a
sequence with the : operator

Numbers <- 1:10
