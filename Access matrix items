You can accces the items by using [ ] brackets. The first number ”1” in the bracket specifies the
row-position, while the second number “2” specifies the column position

//INPUT
Thismatrix <- matrix(c(“apple”, “banana”, “cheery”, “orange”), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
Thismatrix [1, 2]

//OUTPUT
[1] “cherry”

The whole row can be accessed if you specify a comma after the number in the bracket:

//INPUT
Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
Thismatrix [2,]
//OUTPUT
[1] “banana” “orange”

The whole column can be accessed if you specify a comma before the number in the bracket:

//INPUT
Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
Thismatrix [,2]
//OUTPUT
[1] “cherry” “orange”

Access more than one row
More than one row can be accessed if you use the c ( ) function:
Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”, “grape”, “pinapple”, “pear”. “Melon”,
“fig”) , nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
Thismatrix [ c ( 1 , 2 ) , ]

Access more than one column
More than one column can be accessed if you use the c ( ) function:

Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”, “grape”, “pinapple”, “pear”, “melon”,
“fig” ) , nrow = 3 , ncol = 3)

Thismatrix [ , c (1 , 2) ]

//OUTPUT
[,1] [,2]
[1, ] “apple” “orange”
[2, ] “banana” “grape”
[3, ] “cherry” “pinapple”

Add rows and columns
Use the cbind ( ) function to add additional columns in a matrix

//INPUT
Thismatrix <- matrix (c(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”, “grape”, “pinapple”, “pear”, “melon”,
“fig”) , nrow = 3, ncol = 3 )
Newmatrix <- cbind(Thismatrix, c(“strawbery”, “blueberry”, “raspberry”))

# print the new matrix
Newmatrix

//OUTPUT
[ ,1] [ ,2] [ ,3] [ ,4]
[1, ] “apple” “orange” “pear” “strawberry”
