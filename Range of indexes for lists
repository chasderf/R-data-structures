You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range, by
using the : operator
Thislist <- list(“apple”, “banana”, “cherry”, “orange”, “kiwi”, “melon”, “mango”)
(Thislist) [ 2:5 ]
//OUTPUT
[[1]]
[1] “Banana”
[[2]]
[1] “cherry”
[[3]]
[1] “orange”
[[4]]
[1] “kiwi”
