A matrix can be created with the matrix ( ) function. Use the nrow and ncol parameters to
set the amount of rows and columns

More than one row can be accessed if you use the c ( ) function

More than one column can be accessed if you use the c ( ) function:

Thismatrix [, c(1,2) ]

Cbind( ) function to add additional columns in a matrix

Rbind( ) function to add additional rows in a matrix

Use the -c (12) function remove how many rows and columns in a matrix

Use the %in% operator, to find if the specified item is present in a matrix

Use the dim ( ) function to find the number of rows and columns in a matrix

Use the length ( ) function to find the dimension of a matrix

I can combine two matrices with the rbind ( ) or cbind( ) function to combine two or more matrices
together:
